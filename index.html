        <img src="images/mcm.jpg" width="90%"><br><br>
        <small>Known as the Philippines’ seat of technological education excellence,
          Mapúa University is further extending its tradition of excellence in Mindanao
          through the establishment of Malayan Colleges Mindanao, occupying a 3-hectare
          land area along Gen. Douglas MacArthur Highway, beside Matina Town Square in Matina,
          Davao City. MCM is accepting Senior High School students and College students,
          offering an array of courses fit for those looking to develop skills in Engineering and
          Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Computing and Information Science, and Business.
          We have a strong focus on 21st Century digital learning, wherein we not only provide
          state-of-the-art learning facilities but also equip each student with the best digital
          learning tools for ease of access to assignments, exams, and almost ten-thousand online
          learning materials on Wiley from our Vital Source Library.
          <br><br>
          MCM has built a community of competent and innovative leaders who possess attributes
          that make them globally competitive and locally in-demand. This can be attributed to
          our Learner-Centered Outcomes-based Education, a method that helps ensure that student
          learning is focused on attaining industry standards through clearly defined outcomes.
          Within MCM’s DNA is the academic excellence that Mapúa is known for, and we are
          committed to bringing about the same level of excellence into our community here in Mindanao.
